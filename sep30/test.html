                  <p class="bold">Jaguar XF 2016</p>
                  <p>
                    The 2016 Jaguar XF is less expensive than any comparable European sedan, as well as the Cadillac CTS. And this isn’t some ancient model that Jaguar is trying to squeeze a couple of extra years out of. It’s the first all-new XF since Ford sold the company in 2009, and it’s a very modern machine. The XF is largely constructed from aluminum, and at just 3,770 pounds it isn’t just the lightest car in the luxury midsize sport sedan class, it tips the scales more like a compact. Its standard engine is a supercharged 3.0-liter V6 that’s good for 340 hp and 30 mpg on the highway, a combination that can’t be beaten.

                  <p>
                    While there’s no shortage of tuners putting wrenches to factory-fresh hardware in search of performance, it takes a special kind of lunacy to crack open a gleaming 6.0-liter V-12 for a minor displacement increase of 0.3 liters. In this case, the lunatic is German tuner Brabus, and the engine in question resides between the fenders of the Mercedes-AMG S65 coupe. Not content with the twelve-cylinder’s silky-smooth 661 factory-supplied ponies, the masterminds at Brabus set about poking around the engine’s nether regions. In S65, twelve forged pistons were required to match the scantly increased cylinder bores.
